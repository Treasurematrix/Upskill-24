</head>

<body>
    <h1> A Brief Introduction of Myself</h1>
    <p> My name is Chioma M. Nwosu, a wife and a mother of two [for now... smiles] </p> <br>
    I studied Applied Biochemistry  from NAU, Awka, but a business woman now.
    <p> I have always love tech and have been looking for avenue to explore this interest of mine.</p> <br>
I had join several programmes that promises to teach and give me the basic that i need, unfortunately most of those programs stopped half way
leaving me more confused than enlightened.
<p> When i came across Upskill 24 in a whatsApp group, i was skeptical but also hopeful that this could be the life-time opportunity that i am looking for.</p><br>
so far so good, i am really enjoying web development for the first time, i can somewhat see a green light for me at the end of this program and this is all Thanks to you Genesys Upskill.
<P> <h2> my expectations for Upskill' 24:</h2>Is to become a professional at the end of this program, to be sound and confident in my newly Acquired skill and productive in the workforce.</P>
